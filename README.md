3. Given a phone number. Write a function to clean it up, so it is valid. The rules are as follows:
   If the phone number is less than 10 digits assume that it is a bad number
   If the phone number is longer than 10, then it is a bad number
   If the phone number is 10 digits assume that it is good
   If the phone number consists of 11 symbols and the first one is + and others are numbers, then trim +
   and return remaining 10 digits.
   If the phone number contains + symbol more than one, consider it as a bad number.
   If the phone number contains + symbol not as the first character, consider it as a badnumber.

Ignore any group of fewer than 3 chars at the end
